headers and make files are pretty much the same as the slides.
headerfiles have the declarations of the functions and corresponding parameters.
also headerfiles have constants and variables declared.
the make file has both the PhotoLabTest and PhotoLab, where PhotoLab can be run normally.
PhotoLabTest on the other hand only runs auto test, testing all functions.
Overlay reads a new file/image and stores into a temp array.
that array is read through each pixel making sure the RGB values are not white.
if they are not white they replace the pixel in the original picture's array
posterize first turns all numbers before target digits to 1. 
then it targets target bit to be anded with 0 while all others bits are 1 so it does not change
noise, uses a random generator, scans through only a percentage of the image and turns the pixel white
tiltshift/surprise, blurs the image with blur logarithm  replacing only pixels not in the offset/tiltshift area. 
PhotoLab runs only the printmenu.
